# American Sign Language-to-text-conversion-and-Virtual-Keyboard


# ASL Detection:
      • Utilizes computer vision and machine learning.
      • Real-time hand gesture recognition from webcam video input.
  => Initialization:-
      •	Initializes variables for image size, labels, hand detector, and classifier models.
  => Video Processing:-
      • Opens webcam and captures frames./n
      •	Detects hands using a hand detector model.
      •	Crops and resizes the image based on the hand bounding box.
  => Classification:-
      •	Uses CNN-trained classifier model.
      •	Predicts hand gestures corresponding to the image.
      •	Writes recognized characters to a text file and plays a sound if not predicted in the last five seconds.
  => Visualization:-
      •	Displays real-time video stream with an overlay of recognized characters.
  => Termination:-
      •	Function ends by pressing the 'q' key.
      •	Closes file object, destroys window, and releases webcam.
  => Output:-
      •	Returns a rendered HTML template.



#Virtual keyboard 
  =>	Input Technology:
      •	Utilizes a virtual keyboard with a blue pointer for tactile-free typing.
  =>	Implementation Libraries:
      •	Implements the solution using OpenCV and wxPython libraries.
  =>	Frame Capture and Processing:
      •	Captures frames from the webcam to serve as input data.
      •	Applies advanced image processing techniques using OpenCV for precise hand gesture detection.
  =>	Gesture-based Letter Selection:
      •	Maps hand gestures to the selection of letters on the virtual keyboard.
  =>	Interactive Output:
      •	Integrates the selected letters seamlessly into the display of the virtual keyboard.
  =>	Enhanced Functionality:
      •	Provides additional features, such as clearing the virtual keyboard or inserting spaces between selected letters.
